Acquisition software
====================

The acquisition software is called ``eego``.

Selecting the number of amplifiers
----------------------------------

When connecting the amplifiers to the recording computer, the ``eego`` software might
already be set with the correct number of amplifiers or not. If not, you have to
change the number of amplifiers before starting an acquisition workflow or you won't be
able to select the desired amplifier settings and montage for your cap.
