If the amplifier battery is low or if you need to power an active auxiliary box A, you
can use the `XT-20000QC3`_ power bank. This powerbank has 2 USB port and a DC jack port
which can be used to simultaneously power and charged the amplifier and other
peripherals.

.. warning::

    Before plugging the amplifier in the `XT-20000QC3`_ power bank, make sure the DC
    voltage is set to 12V or it will damage the amplifier. To modify the output voltage,
    hold the power button.

.. warning::

    The `XT-20000QC3`_, or other power bank should not be used to power the 128 or 256
    channels trigger cables. The trigger cable won't pull enough power from the USB port
    which will result in the battery/power bank shutting down and in the amplifier
    desynchronization/disconnection.
